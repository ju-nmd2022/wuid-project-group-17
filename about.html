              Bite of Asia was created by Jie Chen, Evellin Miyamoto and Takoda
              Huff in 2022 with a focus on traditional Asian recipes. We are a
              team of people from different countries, but with the same
              passion: Asian food. <br />
              <br />
              We created the website and the book looking forward to offering
              the possibility to find recipes from Asian countries in one place
              matching the time you have to cook, the expertise, and the wanted
              flavours. <br />
              <br />
